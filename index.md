Hi! I am Saad, currently working at an Cloud DevOps internee at SkipQ, a silicon valley based startup, California USA. In the past I have worked as Data Analyst at SoftStack Technologies - an entrepreneurial software company. I did my Bachelors in Computer Science from FAST National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Pakistan.

## Academic Interests

I like to study deep neural networks as they are capable of tackling a whole host of new complex problems such as image, language and speech recognition, network activity and what not. Also allowing machines to learn how features in the data combine into increasingly higher level, abstract forms.
